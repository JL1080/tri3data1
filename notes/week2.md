## 5.5 Actions
- GNU General Public License allows anyone to use the code but not distribute it in a private manner
- MIT License gives more leniency to the user. Allows people to use code and distrubute freely without the need to credit the original creator.
- I chose the MIT License because I have been utilizing it a lot for most of my projects. I am fine with people using my code and distributing it.

## 5.6 Notes
- Multi-Factor Authentication (Fingerprint, Physical Card, Link to Phone or Email)
- Virus - Duplicate themselves across systems.
- Malware - Infiltrate a system through impersonation (email, ‘friendly’ website), damaging the system after getting in.
- Encryption and Decryption Caesar Cipher
- Rumkin Tools ← This website is really cool, holding tons of different ways to encrypt and decrypt a message. Try it!
- Asymmetric Encryption - Public and Private key
- Phishing - Trick the user into providing personal information, usually an email or ‘friendly’ website.
- Keylogger - Records user keystrokes in order to gain passwords or other confidential information.
- Rogue Access Point - Intercepting data across a network.

## 5.6 Action
- In the previous trimester when we did CRUD we had email, name, and phone number in the database.
- I feel like many people don't understand how important PII is. My PII is probably more exposed than I know because of advertising companies.
- Good passwords are strings of letters and numbers that are hard to crack or brute force. Bad passwords are common words and short. Another step is to utilize two step authentication.
- Symmetric Encryption is when you only use one key to encrypt and decrypt. Asymmetric encryption is when you have a public and private key. Asymmetric encryption is utilized in SSH PubKey Authentication.
- When deploying to the web we utilized certbot for an SSL certificate. The ssl cert encrypts our site to https.
- Email Phishing is something that I have seen a lot. I have never fallen for it but I get a lot of spam emails that are trying to get my PII. Another phishing technique is deceptive phishing.
