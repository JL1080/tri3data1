# Week 0: (3/7/22 ~ 3/11/22)

## TPT 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
### Notes:
* UAVs/Drones often used for beneficial usage, but there are some unintended usages like unintended usages
* Dopamine plays role in the emotions we feel
* Playing videogames or watching social media gives joy to people, but too much can lead to some serious dopamine issues
* Telephone trees are designed to save employers' money, but also to reduce hold time for customers
* Innovation in phone trees, voice recognition, or keypad often enables customers to find answers quickly

### Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

#### Beneficial:
* Effcient work from multitasking
* Less errors are made from computers than hand
* Faster communication and collaboration

#### Harmful:
* Unhealthy mental and physical issues
* Cyber crimes such as privacy problems (ransomware)
* Reduces time spent in real life

### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Dopamine issues are real, neither parent conspiracy nor fake. Anyone can get dopamine from doing something enjoyable, such as gaming, eating, shopping, etc, but having too much can be a problem. People get addicted and start becoming aggressive. They can't control themselves. A lot of the times, many students, like me, spend time playing games, go on SNS, or go outside when they are supposed to study and work on self-development for school. Sometimes, when I'm on my phone looking at social media, I think that I need to focus on what I should do first than getting distracted to what I shouldn't.

## TPT 5.2 Digital Divide
### Notes:
* Even though the technology has improved over time, there are some places don't have access to internet
* Some countries may have restricted access, for instance China and America may have divide in service allowed in their countries
* There are some places or religious groups that don't use technology for their choice
* In education, equity requires school to provide materials like computers and Chrome books, but some schools like Del Norte HS prefers to bring personal laprops
* Internet blockers at router and lack of admin password can make school computer less productive than personal laptop or computer

### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Many people empower themselves into the digital world by accessing to the technology they have nearby. As time have passed, technology has improved and made it much easier for people to have access on the Internet.
### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Someone that is empowered can offer and show their internet access to the others who are not empowered. For example, in our school, Del Norte High School, we can create a club that show and describe what digital world looks like and how it works.
### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Personally, I do not think that a paper or red tape is blocking digital empowerment. Most people nowadays have their own laptops, computers, or phones to empower themselves into the digital world. In Del Norte, the district is providing Chromebooks to the students, which are actually cutting down that barrier or red tape for digital empowerment.
