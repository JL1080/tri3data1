# Week 1: (3/14/22 ~ 3/18/22)

## 5.3 Computer Bias
### Notes
* Computer Bias is how computers choose our content and make sure that we can choose one thing in front of the other
* Bias is usually a bad thing but there are positive and negative of bias
* Example: Netflix and Google use user input to give users what material they want to see
* On Gun Laws Pro Choice on the NRA page there will not be an ad that says not to buy guns

### 5.3 Actions
* The HP computers are racist video shows the hp face tracking system and that a darker skinned gentleman was not getting tracked compared to a white female who was more easily tracked
* The owner of the computer probably didn’t think that it was intentional because it seems like he made this video as a joke instead of actually getting offended from it
* This probably happened because there has not been enough testing on the feature so in dark rooms with various people of different skin tones
* This is not harmful in this sense because it can be fixed with updates but it was not meant to be harmful or exclude people because they don’t care about skin tone or race when selling their products because they are receiving money either way
* It should be corrected because it is an extra feature that can help them sell more of their devices

## 5.4 Crowdsourcing
### Notes
* Crowdsourcing is the ability to information with many people and share information to others
* It can also be used in distributed computing and other actions to share data
* Ex: Wikipedia how anyone can add information but it is still fact checked
* Cryptocurrency and block chain are part of crowdsourcing as the exchange of money between many investors  
* We have used data from APIs and other external data and it shows obtaining or analyzing data

### 5.4 Actions
* A Crowdsource idea is that the students who are working on a CSP can get feedback from peers on their project so that they can improve on it.
* A crowdsourcing idea is that for the yearbook that ASB can create a big dataset or database that shows everyone’s photos organized by name and grade. It could also be quickly cross checked with all students in Del Norte High School so it can be quickly known which person is not going to appear in the yearbook. Crowdsourcing would allow a lot of input for ASB so that they can complete the yearbook quickly.
